## Welcome to my Phase 1 Project - A Personal Cellar Tracker! ##

# Intro #
This small application will provide users with a lightweight source to list, categorize, and rate wine and spirits that they have enjoyed!

# Features #
1. Add a beverage to be stored to your personal list.
2. Categorize beverage by type: including lables for vintage, spirit type, country of origin, and more!
3. Create a custom list of entries
4. Add, delete, or edit entries.
5. Built in label information (grape varietal info, spirits history, region info)

# Behind the Scenes #
1. Use 'Open Brewery DB' API to return brewery data 
2. Use 'Global Wine Score' API to return wine score data
3. Build a custom data base with Wine Appellation info. Likely to start with France, USA, and Italy. Likely to expand.
