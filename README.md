## Welcome to my Phase 1 Project - A Personal Cellar Tracker! ##

# Intro #
This small application will provide users with a lightweight source to list, categorize, and rate wine and spirits that they have enjoyed! Included in the .json files is a list of grape varietals and key growing regions (to be expanded soon!)

# Features #
1. Add a beverage to be stored to your personal cellar list.
2. Recall your cellar list.
3. Browse grape varietal information.


# Instructions #
1. Use node.js version 20.10.0 or newer to enable usage of json-server and live-server.

2. Use json-server to watch 'my-wine-collection.json' and 'varietal-info-db.json'. Depending on your environment, you may need to set these to different ports. I use 3000(default) and 3001.

# Future Goals #
1. Expand varietals and wine regions data.
2. Implement wine region search and display functionality.
3. Implement an external API for average market prices, more regional information, etc.
4. Filter and organize the search dropdowns.
5. More styling!
